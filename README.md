# InstagramBot
> Check unfollows for a given user.

## General info
I wanted to create this bot to improve my skills in Selenium and to use a safe bot to check unfollows just for my and friends purposes. :)

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.8.2
* Selenium - version 3.141.59
* ChromeDriver - version 87.0.4280.88

## Setup
Download ChromeDriver from [developers site](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).\
You have to edit config.py and enter you accounts details. It can be newly created account just for bot-related purposes or you main account. If you use your real account details your account can be private to check unfollows. In another case you have to change it for a moment for bot be able to check unfollows. :) Watch out for anormal activity that Instagram can trace.\
Change desired username in my_bot.get_not_following_back and run main.py.
